 TODO:
 - Create a label in the top left and bottom right corner of the app view. You might want to bump the text size up to 28pt. (Don't forget about the Attributes Inspector!)
 - Add a label to the center of the view. Its text size should be 40 pt.
 - Create four buttons with the follow labels: 4 of clubs, 3 of spades, 8 of diamonds, and 10 of hearts
 - Hook these buttons up to IBActions. You can hook them each up to their own IBActions, or just have one single IBActions that they are all attached to.
 - When a button is pressed, update the labels accordingly (the ones in the corner should display the suit and the one in the center should display the value).
